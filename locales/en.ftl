email-session-accepted-body = Dear $NAME,
  
  We are excited to let you know that your RustFest Global submission titled *"$TITLE"* has been accepted and would be included in the lineup of *$EVENT_TITLE*! The event will take place on
  {DATETIME($event_date, month: "long", year: "numeric", day: "numeric")},
  starting at {DATETIME($event_date, hour: "numeric", minute: "numeric", timeZoneName: "short")}.
  In case for any reason you are not going to be able to present please let us know ASAP. We have already transferred the session details submitted by you to the conference management interface at:
  
  > [cms.rustfest.global](https://cms.rustfest.global)
  >
  > - CMS username: `$USERNAME`
  > - CMS password: `$PASSWORD`

  You can use these account details to access the CMS. After logging in you can double-check & change the details of your session, upload a speaker photo, contact details and more. Please don't forget to change the password after your first login.
    
  As our guest you will also be receiving a full-access pass, valid for all events of the current season, in a separate message. If you have already purchased a ticket we can refund you, just let the team know in email (please include the ticket number of your purchase in your message).
  
  If your session will be presented in a language other than English, please make sure your pre-recorded presentation arrives to the team in-time to [produce subtitles](https://rustfest.global/cfp/#supported-languages) for the live airing of the talk. This typically means you should send your final recording at least 10 days ahead of the event. We have a [Speaker Guide on the website](https://rustfest.global/information/speaker-guide/) that can help you with any technical questions. If you would like to purchase gear (michrophone, web camera, headphones etc.) to improve the quality of your session you can have your purchase reimbursed, [as part of our presenter perks](https://rustfest.global/cfp/#the-perks) (Note: certain limitations apply, when in doubt talk to a team member before making a purchase).
  
  With any questions or inquiries you can contact the team at the email address [speakers@rustfest.global](mailto:speakers@rustfest.global) or by replying to this message.
  
  Thank you again for your submission and looking forward to welcoming you at $EVENT_TITLE!
